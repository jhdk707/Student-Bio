<p class="center">I am an avid lover of cooking, food, music & vinyl, cars, watches and all things mechanical, especially old handmade tools.<br><br>
   My mothers side of my family is from the Portugese archpelagio called the Azores. My fathers side of the family has long established roots in many generations in the states, but they are of Irish and Russian descent.<br><br>

    I enjoy film and TV as well, dialouge and story telling is what draws me in. I really love when a movie can keep you hooked while remaining simple, such as "The Lighthouse".<br><br>I love collecting records, tinkering with my stereo and discovering music and showing it to others. You will most likely find me listening to metal, jazz, classical or punk, and quite often utilizing my subwoofers to enjoy some classic rap and hip-hop or other bass based music.
    I would also like to give a shout-out to Jerry Reed and Hank Williams.<br><br>
    My favorite animals would be otters, owls and wolves. Cats too. Octopi and orcas are also very interesting. There are 14 "O"s in this section about animals. I think theres 67 in this bio so far not counting this sentence or anywhere else on the page. I will continue to update as this is a work in progress as I continue to work on my coding skills in this cohort. I did forget to start making a change log, but I will show you a cute series of pictures I sent my girlfriend because I was figuring out how to do stuff.
